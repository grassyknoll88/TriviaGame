Our week 5 assignment was to create a trivia game utilizing timers to progress from question to question.

I created a Trivia game using JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML. Layout needed to have properly formatted HTML and  CSS styling.

### Instructions

Create a GitHub repo called TriviaGame, then clone the repo to your computer.
Create a file inside of the TriviaGame folder called index.html. This is where you'll mark up all of your HTML.
Don't forget to include a script tag with the jQuery library.
Create a folder inside of the TriviaGame folder called assets.
Inside assets, create three folders: css, javascript, images



In your css folder, create a style.css file.
In your javascript folder, create an app.js file; here you'll write all of your JavaScript and jQuery.
In your images folder, save whatever images you'd like to use in this exercise.
