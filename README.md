Our week 5 assignment was to create a trivia game utilizing timers to progress from question to question.

Overview

 I created a Trivia game using JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML. Layout needed to have properly formatted HTML and s CSS styling. 

Assignment requirements:

Requirements: -Create a trivia form with multiple choice or true/false options (your choice). -The player will have a limited amount of time to finish the quiz. -The game ends when the time runs out. The page will reveal the number of questions that players answer correctly and incorrectly. -Don't let the player pick more than one answer per question. -Don't forget to include a countdown timer.
